    The fixture file contains an entry for each row that we want to insert into the
    database. Each row is given a name. In the case of the Rails-generated fixture,
    the rows are named one and two. This name has no significance as far as the
    database is concerned—it is not inserted into the row data. Instead, as we’ll
    see shortly, the name gives us a convenient way to reference test data inside
    our test code. Inside each entry you’ll see an indented list of name-value pairs.
    Just like in your config/database.yml , you must use spaces, not tabs, at the start
    of each of the data lines, and all the lines for a row must have the same indentation.
